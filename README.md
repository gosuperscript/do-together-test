## ~~Take home~~ Do together test
Hi and thank you for your interest in Superscript! This repository is meant for you and us to review together.

### What does the code do?
This is a simplified version of what Superscript does best: get someone's needs, turn it into a quote, get that quote rated and sell a policy!

### What not to look out for?
Don't go scouring every folder. We only added a couple of tests and classes.

Don't go looking for database; out of simplicity we left it out. The code is more than difficult enough as it is.

### What to look out for?
Check out the tests folder for our work. You will find the references to our work there.

### What is the interview going to be like?

1. First, we'd like to get your general opinion on the code
2. Second, we'd like to dive into the overall architecture a bit
3. Third, we're going to look at some specific pieces of code
4. Finally, we're going to discuss implementing a new business case - how could we approach it?

Typically, we'll look at the code itself, the interface the code provides and how the approach would scale if we add more products or teams. We'd love to hear your suggestions!
